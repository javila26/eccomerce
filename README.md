## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I had some issues figuring out how to remove items but the solution was easier that I thought, just using the splice method I can delete an specific element of the items array.

You can check it out here:

```js
function handleRemoveItem(id) {
  setCartItems((prevItems) => {
    const updatedItems = [...prevItems.items];

    const existingCartItemIndex = updatedItems.findIndex(
      (cartItem) => cartItem.id === id
    );

    const existingCartItem = updatedItems[existingCartItemIndex];

    console.log(existingCartItemIndex);

    if (existingCartItem) {
      updatedItems.splice(existingCartItemIndex, 1);
    }

    return {
      items: updatedItems,
    };
  });
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to improve my hooks usage when using React in general. I've heard it's pretty normal that at the beginning you will try to solve everything with state and I feel that was my case for this project until I look for more options on internet on how to accomplish some things.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/) - Great to have interactive explanations of how code works.
- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I use one this pretty often if MDN wasn't too clear for me.
